# GD2.2_Bugs
Public bug tracker for the 2.2 update of Geometry Dash.

Well, you all know the drill for this. Everyone knows how RobTop programs his game, it's going to be absolutely covered with bugs everywhere, so let's get ahead and catalog all that we can find. In order to ensure this is as professional and simple as possible (and not be a complete misery to sort through when I did this last time), I will need to request all of you posting to follow a simplified version of a Bug Report done in video game companies. It's to nowhere near the same level but it is heavily inspired by such a report.

- Describe the bug with a simple title. This will help to more easily distinguish if the bug is a unique one from what others have posted.

- What device was used when this bug occurred? (Mobile, Computer, Tablet or other)

- What operating system was used when this bug occurred? (Microsoft Windows, Apple, Linux, Google iOS, Apple iOS or other)

- Explain the bug you have found. What ends up happening? What is causing the bug to happen in the first place? How can the bug be re-produced? What is the result of the bug (as in does the game crash, does nothing happen at all, is an error displaying, etc)?
